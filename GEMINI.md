**Progress:**

*   Created the directory structure for the `proxy-server` application.
*   Defined the `Frontend` and `Connection` services in `src/services/Frontend.ts`.
*   Attempted to implement the `FrontendLive` layer in `src/layers/FrontendLive.ts` to provide a live implementation of the `Frontend` service using WebSockets.

**Current Challenges:**

*   Encountering persistent TypeScript type errors in `FrontendLive.ts` when trying to create and emit a `Connection` object within a `Stream`.
*   The core issue seems to be correctly constructing a `Connection` service instance and providing it to the `Stream.async` `emit` function in a way that satisfies the type checker.

**Immediate Goals:**

1.  Resolve the type errors in `FrontendLive.ts` to create a correctly typed `Stream` of `Connection` objects.
2.  Update `src/index.ts` to use the `FrontendLive` layer and start the WebSocket server.
3.  Verify the implementation by running the `proxy-server` and ensuring it logs a message for each new connection.
