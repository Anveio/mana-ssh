# @mana-ssh/tui-web-canvas-renderer ‚Äì Agent Log

## Mission

Deliver a standalone, high-performance canvas renderer for the Mana SSH terminal stack. This package is responsible for taking the interpreter output from `@mana-ssh/vt` (screen buffer, cursor state, attributes) and drawing it into an HTML `<canvas>` element. It must track cursor/selection, handle resize events gracefully, and provide hooks so higher-level frameworks (React, vanilla JS, etc.) can embed the renderer in any web application.

## Design goals

- **Renderer-only responsibility** ‚Äì no parser or interpreter logic. Consumers feed the renderer with terminal snapshots/updates.
- **Pluggable API** ‚Äì expose a simple interface (`init`, `applyUpdates`, `resize`, `dispose`) so UI layers can orchestrate lifecycle without knowing about the drawing internals.
- **Performance-first** ‚Äì leverage canvas 2D context (and GPU acceleration where available) to minimise DOM churn. Keep allocations low, batch draw calls, and provide dirty-region updates.
- **Robustness** ‚Äì support dynamic resize, high-DPI displays, cursor inversion, theme changes, and fall back gracefully when palette entries are missing.
- **Extensibility** ‚Äì act as the reference implementation for future renderers (SVG, WebGL, React Native). Document the renderer contract so new backends can be dropped in.

## Feature surface (target parity)

- **Rendering fidelity** ‚Äì Unicode aware glyph pipeline (wide cells, combining marks, emoji), ANSI 16/256/truecolor, SGR attributes (bold, faint, italic, underline styles, blink, inverse, hidden, strikethrough), cursor that supports block/bar/underline shapes with opacity/blink, and selection overlays.
- **Fonts & layout** ‚Äì configurable font stacks, size/line-height/letter-spacing, bold/italic fallbacks, high-DPI scaling, ligature toggle, optional font metrics caching, accurate reflow on resize, emoji/image fallbacks.
- **Graphics/media** ‚Äì Sixel and inline image protocols (kitty/iTerm) as stretch goals, support for pixel art (braille, box drawing), optional WebGL acceleration path.
- **Color & theme** ‚Äì dynamic palette swapping without flicker, cursor/selection theming, inverse rendering, theme transitions, background images or transparency for compositing.
- **Performance** ‚Äì dirty-region batching, devicePixelRatio aware rendering, offscreen canvas support, frame timing diagnostics (draw call count, last frame duration), backpressure handling when updates flood.
- **Interaction** ‚Äì text selection (block/column/word), clipboard hooks, mouse mode indicators, focus outlines, visual bell, hyperlink underline hover states.
- **Resilience** ‚Äì graceful context loss recovery, caps for payloads (e.g. Sixel), defensive fallbacks for missing glyphs, lifecycle hooks (`dispose`) that tear down timers.
- **Accessibility & UX** ‚Äì high-contrast mode, focus cues, screen-reader overlay compatibility, configurable cursor styling, ability to invert/tint for readability.
- **Integration hooks** ‚Äì screenshot/export API, instrumentation callbacks, external theme updates, ability to surface renderer diagnostics to host UI.

## Testing + regression strategy

- **Reference fixtures** ‚Äì store canonical terminal snapshots (JSON describing `TerminalState`) plus expected PNGs rendered with our renderer. Tests hydrate the snapshot, render into a headless canvas, and compare against the PNG using `pixelmatch`.
- **Pixel comparisons** ‚Äì use `pixelmatch` with a low threshold (‚âà0.05) to allow minor anti-aliasing differences. On failure, write three artifacts per scenario under `test/__artifacts__/<case>/`: `expected.png`, `actual.png`, and `diff.png` (magenta highlights).
- **Composite artifact** ‚Äì build `side-by-side.png` by rendering the three images into a new canvas with a dark background, 16px gutters, and a heading row (monospace text) labelling each column ‚Äúexpected‚Äù, ‚Äúactual‚Äù, and ‚Äúdiff‚Äù. Keep hierarchy clear: labels at 14‚Äì16px, subtle separators (e.g. thin vertical lines, drop shadow) to emphasize differences, and consistent padding before exporting via `toBuffer()`.
- **Artifact plumbing** ‚Äì Vitest‚Äôs `onTestFailed` hook (or per-test try/finally) dumps artifacts and logs their paths so CI can surface them. Locally, tests print `open test/__artifacts__/.../side-by-side.png` instructions; in CI we can attach them as build artifacts.
- **Snapshot refresh flow** ‚Äì provide a script (`bun run test:update-snapshots`) that re-renders fixtures and overwrites the expected PNGs after manual review. Guard with git diffs to ensure updates are intentional.
- **Parameterized coverage** ‚Äì cover core glyph types (ASCII, CJK, emojis, combining marks), attribute permutations (bold+italic, foreground/background combos, SGR resets), cursor states, palette swapping, resizing, and selection overlays. Each scenario renders minimal yet representative buffers to keep PNGs small.
- **Perf smoke tests** ‚Äì include a stress case that renders a large dirty region and asserts draw call counts remain below a threshold; rely on diagnostics exposed by the renderer.
- **Spec tracking** ‚Äì `docs/renderer-test-spec.md` mirrors this checklist with ‚úÖ/üü°/‚õîÔ∏è status so future additions can tie back to documented scenarios.

## Current status

- Public renderer contract exported from `src/index.ts`, including theme, metrics, and lifecycle types.
- Vitest harness in place (node-canvas + pixelmatch + snapshots) with an initial rendering smoke test.
- Package scripts wired for `vitest` execution; awaiting concrete drawing implementation.

## 2025-09-27 ‚Äì OSC/DCS wiring & palette overrides

- Canvas renderer now understands the expanded `TerminalAttributes`/`TerminalColor` shapes from `@mana-ssh/vt`, including italic, underline (single/double), faint, inverse, and strikethrough rendering.
- Palette updates (`TerminalUpdate.type === 'palette'`) are cached and applied during paint, allowing OSC 4/104 and SGR truecolour writes to update the framebuffer without theme churn.
- Diagnostics track the latest OSC, DCS, and SOS/PM/APC payloads so host layers can react to window title, graphics, or status messages without re-parsing effects.
- OSC/DCS/SOS-only updates no longer trigger full repaints; we repaint only when cells/colours change, preserving performance for metadata-heavy workloads.
- Added Vitest coverage for palette overrides, diagnostics plumbing, and the enhanced styling pipeline (underline, faint, RGB foregrounds).

## 2025-10-02 ‚Äì Selection roadmap alignment

- Mapped Ghostty's selection lifecycle (pin tracking, per-row slicing, auto-scroll) onto our TypeScript stack; canvas renderer will consume row-level selection segments derived from interpreter snapshots.
- Planned `TerminalSelection` shape in `@mana-ssh/vt` holding anchor/focus points, selection kind (`normal | rectangular`), and status, emitted through new `selection:set|update|clear` deltas so renderers can stay incremental.
- Defined host-layer responsibilities: `@mana-ssh/tui-react` will translate pointer events into selection updates, manage 60‚ÄØ% inclusion thresholds, and orchestrate auto-scroll timers via Effect.
- Determined renderer work: draw themed selection rectangles before glyphs, respect optional foreground overrides, and add pixel regression fixtures for single-line, multi-line, and rectangular highlights.
- Test matrix covers VT helpers (word/line computations, rectangular ranges), React controller event flows, renderer pixel diffs, and Playwright E2E copy-on-select behaviour.

## Immediate next steps

1. Emit `selection:*` deltas from `@mana-ssh/vt` (drag lifecycle, word/line helpers) and persist selection on the snapshot.
2. Teach `@mana-ssh/tui-react` to emit selection updates (pointer handling, rectangle modifiers, auto-scroll Effect) and wire copy-on-select.
3. Update the canvas renderer to consume selection segments and repaint overlays with new pixel regression cases.
4. Expose utility helpers (measure cells, palette resolution, cursor drawing) with accompanying unit tests.
5. Publish typed entry point so `@mana-ssh/tui-react` can import the renderer instead of inlining it.

## Longer-term roadmap

- Benchmark canvas vs SVG/WebGL renderers once alternate packages exist.
- Add optional offscreen canvas support for smoother animations.
- Expose instrumentation hooks (FPS, draw timings) for performance dashboards.
- Consider fallback HTML renderer for legacy browsers that lack canvas acceleration.

## Memory Bank

- 2025-10-02: Selection pipeline agreed‚ÄîVT gains `TerminalSelection`, React host owns pointer ‚Üí update wiring, canvas renderer paints themed highlights with new pixel fixtures, and tests span VT units, React controller, pixel diffs, and Playwright copy flows.
- 2025-10-02: Implemented `selection.ts` helpers + tests in `@mana-ssh/vt` (bounds, per-row segments, collapsed detection) and plumbed selection into `TerminalState`/`TerminalUpdate` for downstream renderers.
- 2025-10-02: Canvas renderer now surfaces `currentSelection` plus `onSelectionChange`; React controller proxies callbacks/handle access so consumers observe selection changes regardless of input source.
